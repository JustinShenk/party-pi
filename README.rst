Emotion detection game using computer vision. Note: This repo is no longer maintained. Contact @justinshenk or open an Issue if you have any questions.

Description
===========

Interactive game that ranks players by their ability to show an emotion (eg, "Show surprise").

Emotion detection is accomplished using an Inception-based neural network trained in TensorFlow on the FER2013 dataset. Face detection is accomplished using OpenCV's Haar cascade.
